```
Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site

gatsby new project-name https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-portfolio-cara
```

3. **Open the code and start customizing!**

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!


4. **Add Netlify CMS to your site**

Log in Netlify

install dependencies:
```sh
npm install --save netlify-cms-app gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms
```

##### Configuration
We will deploy to Netlify from a GitHub repository which requires the minimum configuration.

Create a `config.yml` file in the directory structure you see below:
```sh
â”œâ”€â”€ static
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ admin
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.yml
```

Paste the following configurationin `config.yml`:
```sh
backend:
  name: git-gateway
  branch: main

media_folder: static/img
public_folder: /img

collections:
  - name: 'blog'
    label: 'Blog'
    folder: 'content/blog'
    create: true
    slug: 'index'
    media_folder: ''
    public_folder: ''
    path: '{{title}}/index'
    editor:
      preview: false
    fields:
      - { label: 'Title', name: 'title', widget: 'string' }
      - { label: 'Publish Date', name: 'date', widget: 'datetime' }
      - { label: 'Description', name: 'description', widget: 'string' }
      - { label: 'Body', name: 'body', widget: 'markdown' }
```

Insert plugin in `gatsby-config.js` <br/>

```sh
plugins: [`gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms`]
```

##### Push to GitHub

```sh
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NEW_REPO_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```

##### Add your repo to Netlify

Go to Netlify, log in and select 'New Site from Git'. 

##### Enable Identity and Git Gateway
Netlify's Identity and Git Gateway services allow you to manage CMS admin users for your site without requiring them to have an account with your Git host or commit access on your repo. 

From your site dashboard on Netlify:

Go to **Settings > Identity**, and select Enable Identity service.
Under **Registration preferences**, select Open or Invite only.  
Scroll down to **Services > Git Gateway**, and click **Enable Git Gateway**. This authenticates with your Git host and generates an API access token. In this case, we're leaving the Roles field blank, which means any logged in user may access the CMS. 

##### Updating Your Website
Login to your site's /admin/ page and create a new post by clicking New Blog.
