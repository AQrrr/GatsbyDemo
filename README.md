1. **Create a Gatsby site.**

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying this project

```

2. **Start developing.**

Navigate into your new site's directory and start it up.

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!



## 📝 Using and modifying this starter

**Important Note:** Please read the guide [Shadowing in Gatsby Themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/shadowing/) to understand how to customize the underlying theme!

This starter creates a new Gatsby site that installs and configures the theme [`@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-cara`](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-cara).

Have a look at the theme's README and files to see what options are available and how you can shadow the various components including Theme UI. Generally speaking you will want to place your files into `src/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-cara/` to shadow/override files. The Theme UI config can be configured by shadowing its files in `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/`.

### Changing content

The content of this project is defined in four `.mdx` files inside the theme's `sections` folder. You can override the files `intro.mdx`, `projects.mdx`, `about.mdx` and `contact.mdx`. This starter has overriden the `intro.mdx` file as an example. Place the other files in the same `src/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-cara/sections/` folder.

You have to use the `<ProjectCard />` component inside `projects.mdx` to display the cards. Example:

```md
### Change your `static` folder

The `static` folder contains the icons, social media images and robots.txt. Don't forget to change these files, too!
